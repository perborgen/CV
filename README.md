# Per Harald Borgen
I'm a web developer, with a background as an kids app entrepreneur and a bachelors degree in economics.

My passion is building products that solve problems or entertain people.

I'm self driven, hard working and easy going.

## Background:

### Founders & Coders (2015)
I started learning how to code while running Propell, as my interest for the field has grown steadily the last few years. In january I was accepted into Founders & Coders in London, a 3 month intensive coding bootcamp. After graduation, I've worked with commercial clients, mostly building MVP's for startups.

### Propell (2012 - 2014)
I founded a kids app startup Propell and ran it for 2.5 years as the CEO. Propell's childrens books, learning material and music apps have been downloaded over 1 million times by parents all over the world. My roles included management, marketing & PR, administration, accounting and everything else related to running a startup. Download our Disco Fingers app here.

### Mikrojobb.no (2011)
While studying, I founded a Norwegian site to buy and sell micro services. Mikrojobb quickly grew to be the most popular of its kind in Norway and was aquired by NeedBox.com in 2013.
