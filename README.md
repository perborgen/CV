# Per Harald Borgen
I'm a developer, with a background as a kids app entrepreneur. 

I enjoy building digital products that either solve problems or entertain people. Preferrably in Javascript or Python.

I'm self driven, hard working and easy going. I also hold a bachelor's degree in economics.

## Experience:

### Founders & Coders (2015)
In early 2015 I enrolled as a student at Founders & Coders in London. F&C is a 3 month intensive coding course with a focus on Javascript and Node JS. After graduation, I've worked with commercial clients, mostly building MVP's for startups.

### Propell (2012 - 2014)
After finishing my studies I founded a kids app company named Propell, which I ran for 2.5 years as the CEO. Propell's childrens books, educational material and music apps have been downloaded over 1 million times by parents around the world. My responsibilities included product development, management, marketing, accounting and everything else related to running a startup. Check out our [Disco Fingers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disco-fingers/id809680953?mt=8) app here.

### Mikrojobb (2011)
While studying, I founded a Norwegian site to buy and sell micro services. Mikrojobb quickly grew to be the most popular of its kind in Norway and was acquired by NeedBox.com in 2013.
